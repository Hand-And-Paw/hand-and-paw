          <h2>About adoption</h2>
          <p>Adoption of an animal is a very important step for all participants: for a person, for an animal and a shelter. All sides are interested in finding a new forever home for an animal and keeping the animal safe. That's why there are some rules - requirements to the place where animal will live, and costs -  adoption fee to cover necessary vaccinations and chip, sterilization or neutering. They vary from shelter to shelter and depend from the animal. That's why we can't provide this information on our website. You can always contact a shelter or visit their website to find specifics of their adoption procedure. 
            <br>To get answers to more specific questions we are inviting you to our <a href="#faq">FAQ section.</a>

                  <li>Does the dog I visually like has character I like and ready to deal with?</li>
                  <p>If you are not answering yes to all those questions, it doesn't mean you can't have a dog. How dog behaves and what it needs varies. It depends on it's breed, upbringing, it's mental and health condition.
                    Care takers in the shelters will be glad to answer your questions and tell you all they know about taking care of dogs in general and will share what they know about the dog you like in their shelter. In some shelters you can become a volunteer,take dog for some time or get familiar with dog you like by walking with it.</p>

                  <li>Will I still love it if it doesn't like to cuddle, lie on my lap and as not much interest in me?</li>

                  <li>Am I ready to give my cat freedom to go where she wants when I am not at home or it needs to be limited? How is it possible?</li>
                  <p>Cat's are a bit more tricky than dogs, but there is still room for choice. Cats have different characters like any other animals and if you are looking for specific personality, care taker in a shelter will advise you about their cats. Shelters often seek for temporary family for their cats and kittens - this may help you to find your perfect companion.</p>
