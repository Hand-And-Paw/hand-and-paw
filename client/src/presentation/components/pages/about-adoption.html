          <h2>About adoption</h2>
          <p>Adoption of an animal is a very important step for all participants: for a person, for an animal and a
            shelter. All sides are interested in finding a new forever home for an animal and keeping the animal safe.
            That's why there are some rules - requirements to the place where animal will live, and costs - adoption fee
            to cover necessary vaccinations and chip, sterilization or neutering. They vary from shelter to shelter and
            depend from the animal. That's why we can't provide this information on our website. You can always contact
            a shelter or visit their website to find specifics of their adoption procedure.
            <br>To get answers to more specific questions we are inviting you to our <a href="#faq">FAQ section.</a>

              <p>If you are not answering yes to all those questions, it doesn't mean you can't have a dog. How dog
                behaves and what it needs varies. It depends on it's breed, upbringing, it's mental and health
                condition.
                Care takers in the shelters will be glad to answer your questions and tell you all they know about
                taking care of dogs in general and will share what they know about the dog you like in their shelter. In
                some shelters you can become a volunteer,take dog for some time or get familiar with dog you like by
                walking with it.</p>

              <p>Cat's are a bit more tricky than dogs, but there is still room for choice. Cats have different
                characters like any other animals and if you are looking for specific personality, care taker in a
                shelter will advise you about their cats. Shelters often seek for temporary family for their cats and
                kittens - this may help you to find your perfect companion.</p>
