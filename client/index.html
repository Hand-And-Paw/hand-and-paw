          <h2>Why adoption is important?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>You give the animal a better life</strong><br>
            All homeless animals have been lost, given up or abandoned. You are giving them a new life in a loving
            home.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>You help break the cycle of pet overpopulation</strong><br>
            There are not enough homes for all the animals that are born every year. You confront irresponsible owners
            who don't sterilize or neuter their pets.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>If you adopt, you won't be supporting puppy mills and pet stores</strong><br>
            Most animals raised for sale are housed in poor conditions: in cages and without human companionship. Puppy
            mills will continue to operate until people stop purchasing from them.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>You encourage others to adopt animals</strong><br>
            When your friends ask where you got your amazing pet, you can tell them “He is adopted.” Your happy
            companionship will help to break stereotype that you can't bond with adopted animal.

          <h2>When a lonely animal needs our help?</h2>
          <p>
            The main reasons animals are in shelters: owners give them up, owners passed away or somebody finds them on
            the street.<br>
            <br>
            Many strays are lost pets that were not kept properly indoors or provided with identification.<br>
            <br>
            Don't be afraid of the stray animal and try to help them to find a new home, avoiding stress of being in
            overcrowded shelter or being euthanized.
