          <h2>Why adoption is important?</h2>
          <p>
            Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog, puppy, cat or kitten.
            Best of all, there are so many benefits when you adopt a dog or adopt a cat over buying. <br>
            For instance, pet adoption will almost always be more affordable than buying a puppy for sale from a breeder
            or finding a kitten for sale from a litter.
            There are more benefits as well. <br> Since pets in rescues and shelters usually come from a home where the
            owners ran out of money, got divorced, or had to move,
            it's common to find that the dogs and cats on our website are already housetrained, good with kids, or do
            well with other pets. <br>
            People are finding out that buying a puppy for sale from a breeder isn't all it's cracked up to be, and the
            dogs and cats don't leave the organization without having their shots and being taken to the vet. That means
            less stress, and more savings! So what are you waiting for? Go find that perfect pet!

          <h2>When a lonely animal needs our help?</h2>
          <p> Adopting means you save a life. Too often, shelters euthanize animals due to room constraints,
            but if more people adopted pets instead of buying them, the number of pets euthanized would lower
            dramatically. <br>
            When you adopt, not only do you save your loving new companion, but you make space for other animals who
            desperately need it, creating a domino effect of goodness.
